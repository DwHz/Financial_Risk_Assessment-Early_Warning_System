## üìä Project Overview

The Financial Risk Assessment and Early Warning System is a sophisticated analysis tool built on machine learning and deep learning technologies. It provides comprehensive capabilities for stock market data analysis, future price prediction, and risk assessment through an interactive Streamlit interface. This system is designed for investors, financial analysts, and quantitative researchers who need advanced tools for market analysis and decision support.

### Purpose

This system addresses the challenge of financial risk prediction by:
- Analyzing historical stock data using multiple technical indicators
- Employing advanced machine learning models to predict future price movements
- Assessing potential risk levels through multi-dimensional analysis
- Providing interactive visualizations for better decision-making
- Supporting risk quantification through VaR and other metrics
